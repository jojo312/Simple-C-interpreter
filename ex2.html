<h2>CIS505 Assignment 2</h2>

<em>10 points; due Thursday, September 22</em>

<p>
We will develop a Java-like object-oriented language in stages.
This, the first stage, begins with more-or-less the assignment language from Exercise 1,
<spre>
P  ::=  CL
CL ::=  C;*   (zero or more  C  separated by ; )
C  ::=  L = E  |  if E : CL else CL end  |  print E
E  ::=  N  |  E1 OP E2  | L
OP ::=  +  |  -
L  ::=  I
N  ::=  a nonempty string of digits
I  ::=  a nonempty string of letters, not a keyword
</spre>
but this time implemented by a heap-storage interpreter, like that in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.

<p>
You will extend this language with
initialized declared variables and
parameterized procedures.  (Objects and classes are added later.)
A sample program in the extended language looks like this:
<pre>
int x = 2;
proc p(y, z):
   x = (y - z); q(y); z = 0
end;
proc q(y): x = (x + (y - 1)) end;
p(9, (x+1));
print x
</pre>
Here is the execution of the above program:
<pre>
Parse tree:
[[['int', 'x', '2'],
  ['proc', 'p', ['y', 'z'],
                [['=', 'x', ['-', ['deref', 'y'], ['deref', 'z']]], ['call', 'q', [['deref', 'y']]], ['=', 'z', '0']]],
  ['proc', 'q', ['y'],
                [['=', 'x', ['deref', 'y']]]]],
[['call', 'p', ['9', ['+', ['deref', 'x'], '1']]],
['print', ['deref', 'x']]]]
Execution:
14
activation stack = ['h0']
heap = {
  h0 : {'q': 'h2', 'parentns': 'nil', 'p': 'h1', 'x': 14}
  h1 : ['proc', ['y', 'z'], [['=', 'x', ['-', ['deref', 'y'], ['deref', 'z']]], ['call', 'q', [['deref', 'y']]], ['=', 'z', '0']], 'h0']
  h2 : ['proc', ['y'], [['=', 'x', ['+', ['deref', 'x'], ['-', ['deref', 'y'], '1']]]], 'h0']
  h3 : {'y': 9, 'parentns': 'h0', 'z': 0}
  h4 : {'y': 9, 'parentns': 'h0'}
}
</pre>
The execution shows that the implementation uses an activation stack
(implemented as a Python list) of handles to activation namespaces (dictionaries), where a namespace
holds declared variables and procedures.   Procedures are saved in the
heap as closure objects (lists).  When a procedure is called,
a namespace is allocated, the parameter-argument bindings are stored
in the new namespace, and the namespace's handle is pushed onto the activation stack.
When the procedure completes, the handle is popped.
<em>See Section 5.2.1 of the lecture notes for examples and diagrams about
how this works.</em>


<p>
Here's the extended language's grammar:
<pre>
P : Program
CL : CommandList
C : Command
DL : DeclarationList
D : Declaration
E : Expression
I : Variable
N : Numeral

P  ::=  DL  CL

DL ::=  D;*
   that is, a sequence of zero or more Ds, separated by  ;
   ( DL ::=  D  |  D ; DL  |  empty  )

D  ::=  int I = E  |  proc I ( IL ) : CL end 

CL ::=  C;*
C  ::=  I = E  |  if E : CL1 else CL2 end  |  print E  |  I ( EL )

EL ::=  E,*
E  ::=  N  |  ( E1 OP E2 )  |  I
OP ::=  +  |  -

IL ::=  I,*
I ::=  strings of letters, not including keywords

N ::=  string of digits
</pre>
I have used the PLY parser-generator to make a parser that recognizes this language.   
(See the file, $a234parser.py$.)

<h4>Interpreter input format</h4>

<p>
The input to the interpreter is the list-based parse tree constructed by the parser.
The syntax of parse trees goes like this:
<pre>
PTREE ::=  [DLIST, CLIST]

DLIST ::=  [ DTREE* ]
           where  DTREE*  means zero or more DTREEs
DTREE ::=  ["int", ID, ETREE]  |  ["proc", ID, ILIST, CLIST]

CLIST ::=  [ CTREE* ]
CTREE ::=  ["=", LTREE, ETREE]  |  ["if", ETREE, CLIST, CLIST]
        |  ["print", ETREE]  |  ["call", ID, ELIST]

ELIST ::=   [ ETREE* ]
ETREE ::=  NUM  |  [OP, ETREE, ETREE] |  ["deref", LTREE]  
      where  OP ::=  "+"  | "-"

LTREE ::=  ID

ILIST ::= [ ID* ]
ID    ::=  a nonempty string of letters

NUM   ::=  a nonempty string of digits
</pre>


<h4>Interpreter operation</h4>

I have constructed for you an interpreter, $interpret.py$, that implements
the core assignment language.
When you download
and run the interpreter on a core program, you will see it behaves like this:
<pre>
Type program; OK to do it on multiple lines; terminate with  !
  as the first symbol on a line by itself:
x = 2;
y = (x + 1);
print y
!
Parse tree:
[[], [['=', 'x', '2'], ['=', 'y', ['+', ['deref', 'x'], '1']], ['print', ['deref', 'y']]]]
Execution:
3
namespace = h0
heap = {
  h0 : {'y': 3, 'x': 2}
}
Press Enter key to terminate
</pre>
The parse tree has an empty list of declarations (since the
core language doesn't yet have declarations) and there is no activation
stack but only a handle to the active namespace that holds the program's variables.

<p>
Here are the steps you take to do this assignment:  
<ol>
<li>
Go to the CIS505 assignment page and download the folder, $Ex2$.
It contains the scanner ($a234lex$), parser ($a234parse$), parser-generator library ($ply$), heap ($heapmodule$),
starting
interpreter ($interpret$), and drivers ($run$ and $run0$).  Double-click the $run0$ icon or type $python run.py$
to run the prototype system and test the above example.
<p>
<li>
Within $heapmodule.py$,
replace the active-namespace variable, $ns$, by an activation stack, and add functions that push a handle onto the
activation stack, pop the stack, check if the stack is empty, and return the top handle.
Modify the $allocateNS$ function so that it places a $'parentns':'nil'$ binding in
every newly allocated namespace.
Modify $activeNS$, $initializeHeap$, and $printHeap$ so that they use the stack
(and not $ns$).
Test that the system still executes the starter test cases ok.
<p>
Now, in $interpret.py$, add
integer declarations to $interpretDTREE$: For $int I = E$,  do this: bind $I$ 
to the value of $E$ in the <em>active namespace</em>
(the namespace whose handle
lies at the top of the activation stack).
Make certain that variable $I$ is not already declared in the active namespace.
(If it is already declared, then it's an error that prints a
message and stops execution.)
<em>
It will be simplest if you write a new function, $declare$, add
it to $heapmodule.py$, and call it to declare a new variable.
</em>

<p>
Also, modify the interpreter to enforce that every variable that appears in position $L$
of $L = E$
is already declared.
(Otherwise, it's an error that prints a
message and stops execution.)
<em>
It will be simplest if you modify the $store$ function in $heapmodule.py$
to do the check.
</em>


<p>
<li>
Next, implement procedure declarations in $interpretDTREE$:
For $proc I(IL): CL end$, do this: bind $I$ to the handle of a newly allocated closure (the closure can be implemented as a list, like above, or as a dictionary) that holds
$IL$, $CL$, and the handle to the active namespace. (See the CIS505
notes, Section 5.2.1, for details.)
Make certain that variable $I$ is not already declared in the active namespace
(Otherwise, it's an error that prints a
message and stops execution).
<em>It will be simplest if you write a new function, $allocateClosure$, add it
to $heapmodule.py$, and call it to allocate the closure.</em>

<p>
<li>
Now, implement procedure call in $interpretCTREE$:
For $I(EL)$, do these steps, as described in the CIS505 notes:
<em>(i)</em> Compute the meaning of $I$, verify that the meaning is the handle to a closure,
and extract from the closure the $IL$, $CL$, and global handle.
(If $I$ is not bound to a handle to a closure, it's an error that stops execution.)
<em>(ii)</em> Allocate a new namespace and push the new namespace's handle onto the
activation stack.
<em>(iii)</em>
Within the new namespace,
bind $parentns$ to the global handle extracted from the closure;
evaluate $EL$ and bind their values to the corresponding
names in $IL$.
Make certain that the number of arguments in $EL$ equals the number of parameters in
$IL$.  (Otherwise, it's an error that prints a
message and stops execution).
<em>(iv)</em> Execute $CL$, and upon completion pop the activation stack.

<p>
Since the intepreter now uses local namespaces for parameters
and global namespaces for global variables, you must implement
a two-stage lookup algorithm: within $interpretLTREE$,
when searching for a variable, $V$,
look in the active namespace first; if not there, look for $V$ in the $parentns$
namespace.  (See the CIS505 lecture notes, Section 2.2.1.)
</ol>

<p>
<em>Remember to document appropriately your modified interpreter.
</em>

<h4>Testing</h4>

The $Ex2$ folder contains a file of test cases that you must use.
Use at least these tests to check your implementation.
You might devise additional tests to see if the interpreter detects program
errors and prints appropriate messages.

<p>
Place all the test cases and their output in a file named $tests.txt$

<h4>Either a one- or two-person project...</h4>
You may do this exercise solo or with a partner. If you choose the latter, you must tell the instructor (Schmidt) by Friday evening, September 9, who you and your partner are.
(After the 9th, I won't allow new teams to form.)
Once the instructor OKs your request, you and your partner can work together on the assignment. (When you submit, both you and your partner will submit one and the same program.) 

<h4>Submission and grading</h4>

Make a folder, $Ex2$, and place in it your modified versions of
$heapmodule.py$ and $interpret.py$ and also $tests.txt$.
Zip the folder into a $.zip$ file and submit the $.zip$ file to the CIS505 site on K-State Online.

The teaching assistant will study your work and your tests and apply some
additional tests before scoring the submission.

<h4>Extra credit</h4>
Real languages let you make local declarations within procedure bodies,
like this:
<spre>
int v = 99;
proc p(x, y) :
    int z = 0;
    proc q(a) : v = ((a + y) + z) end;
    z = (x + y);
    q(z)
end;
p(3, v)
</spre>
The syntax for procedures with local variables looks like this:
<pre>
D ::= ...  |  proc I ( IL ) : DL CL end
</pre>
and the parse tree has this form:
<spre>
["proc", ID, ILIST, DLIST, CLIST]
</spre>
For extra credit, modify the parser and interpreter to handle procedures
of this form.  Almost all your work is easy; the interesting part is
handling variable lookups in $interpretLTREE$, which requires a loop that searches the
<em>static chain</em> of $parentns$ links. 
(In the above example, consider how the variables $v$, $a$, $y$,
and $z$ are found when the body of $q$ executes --- see the CIS505 lecture
notes, Section 5.3.1.)

<p>
If you do this extra work, then place into your $Ex2$ folder the following
files:
<dl>
<dd>
the modified file, $a234parse.py$
<dd>
the modified file, $heapmodule.py$
<dd>
the modified file, $interpret.py$
<dd>
$tests.txt$ (the required tests)
<dd>
$extratests.txt$  (extra tests you devised that show how your implementation
handles local declarations within procedure bodies, like the one example
above)
</dl>

</body>
</html>
